This is a instant messasing client using the IRC protocol that I wrote when I was practising C/C++,TCP/IP and socket programming in my early teens.
It was originally intended to be run solely from the windows command line. But a couple of years later in a high school programming
class I added this very simple GUI since at this point I had never created a program with a GUI.
